/**
 * This plugin helps integrate and implement query complexity settings and blocking.
 * Query complexity allows you to define how complex these fields are,
 * and to restrict queries with a maximum complexity.
 * The idea is to define how complex each field is by using a simple number.
 * ```sdl
 * query {
    author(id: "abc") { # complexity: 1
      posts {           # complexity: 1
        title           # complexity: 1
      }
    }
  }
 * ```
 * A simple addition gives us a total of 3 for the complexity of this query. 
 * We can then match this complexity with the maximum complexity of our schema
 * @param schema The generated graphql schema
 * @returns An Apollo server plugin
